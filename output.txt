  Installation ProcessWe do all the work! You enjoy the look.


  The ProcessWhat you can expect when a certified Curb-Ease® Franchisee installs concrete borders.“We do all the work. You enjoy the look.”


  EstimatesHave a Curb-Ease® Franchisee in your area provide you with a free no obligation estimate. Our Franchisee will discuss the various options available to you and help create a solution specifically designed to meet your needs. Curb-Ease® offers a wide selection of colors, stamp impressions and profiles, so you can be sure to achieve the perfect match for your home / landscape project.There are no surprises with Curb-Ease®, all estimates include a detailed quotation and a written guarantee.


  The EquipmentCurb-Ease® self contained custom rigs are designed to carry all the equipment, tools and materials needed to complete your project quickly - with minimum disruption.The curb extruder and sod cutter are smaller than a wheelbarrow, light weight and self propelling.  All equipment has been designed to minimize any unnecessary mess to the customers yard while achieving top efficiency and maneuverability.


  The PrepGround prep is extremely important.  Curb-Ease® removes sod where necessary and installs a compacted base material, ensuring the ground is solid This enables a smooth extrusion of the concrete. Soft flowing lines are recommended for most residential applications as this creates "easy to mow" access for lawn cutting.


  The MixOver the past 24 years Curb-Ease® has worked on improving the curb mix to provide customers with the strongest, most flexible concrete border available.  Aside from the industry standard of cement, sand, water and sometimes color, Curb-Ease® standard mix also contains glass fibre and admixtures added to each mix -- increasing the structural integrity of the concrete.


  Final StepsThe Turbo-Curber® curb machine extrudes the concrete border.  The certified Curb-Ease® operators trowel and finish the curbs by hand.  Once the curbs are smooth the stamp impression is applied giving the concrete border a decorative finish.  The curbing will require a couple days to cure before an industrial acrylic sealer is applied to colored and stamped concrete to enhance and protect the finish.

  Color Right ThroughWide selection of integral colors to choose from.


  When it comes to color, Curb-Ease® mixes the color right into the mix.  The Curber’s Choice® Integral color palette consists primarily of softer earth tones that integrate well with most landscapes and architectural elements. Color viewed on your computer screen is not accurate as monitors vary from computer to computer.  Curb-Ease® offers a wide range of colors in various tones of gray, brown, red, terra cotta, tan, beige, cocoa and kahlua. Estimators carry a printed color chart  and several photos with them to give you a more accurate representation.


  Curb-Ease® uses Curber’s Choice® iron oxide pigments which infuse the concrete with rich, long-lasting, fade-resistant color.  Curb-Ease® offers a wide variety of color options so you can choose a color that will best compliment your home.Integrally colored concrete requires a couple of days to cure before it is sealed with a commercial grade solvent based acrylic sealer.  The sealer is designed to regulate the speed at which the water in the concrete evaporates ( slower is most often better ) while protecting the concrete from any staining from such things as berries or bird droppings etc.CURBER’S CHOICE COLOR CHARTDISCLAIMER: Color selections on this chart are approximate and may not be exactly as it is when extruded and mixed with concrete.  Variations can be expected due to job conditions, cement finishing techniques, use of sealers and slight raw material color drifts.
